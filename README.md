# Different types of algorithms and their sepecificities

## Divide and Conquer 

### 1. Define the subproblem

### 2. Watch out to the recombination !

### 3. Often easier in recursive form

### 4. Interesting to parallelize


## Dynamic programming

### 1. Define the subproblem (usually the same format)

### 2. What is the base case?

### 3. Find recursive formula for general solution


## Greedy algortihms

### 1. Find the seleciton criteria (often easy, but not always)

### 2. Prove that the greedy choice is always safe

### 3. Implement the algorithm (often easy and efficient)
